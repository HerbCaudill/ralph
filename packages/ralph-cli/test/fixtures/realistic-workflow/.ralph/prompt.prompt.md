# Realistic Workflow Test Prompt

You are testing Ralph's session system.

## Instructions

1. Read @.ralph/todo.md to see what tasks need to be done
2. Pick ONE task from the list (preferably the first pending task)
3. Mark that task as completed in the todo.md file
4. Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> if all tasks are done, otherwise just exit normally

This is a test fixture - you don't need to do real work, just update the files.
