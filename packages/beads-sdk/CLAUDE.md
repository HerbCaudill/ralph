# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Typed TypeScript SDK for the [beads](https://github.com/HerbCaudill/beads) issue tracker. Zero runtime
dependencies. Connects directly to the beads daemon via Unix socket for fast operations (<20ms), with
JSONL file fallback for read-only/offline scenarios.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build          # Compile TypeScript to dist/
pnpm dev            # Watch mode compilation
pnpm typecheck      # Type-check without emitting
pnpm test           # Run tests (vitest)
pnpm test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm format         # Format with Prettier
```

## Architecture

```
React App <-> Backend API (localhost) <-> BeadsClient
                                              |-- DaemonTransport  (Unix socket -> .beads/bd.sock)
                                              |-- JsonlTransport   (fallback: parse .beads/issues.jsonl)
```

Eight modules, all ESM:

- **`transport/daemon.ts`** — Sends JSON-RPC requests to the beads daemon via Unix socket. Each call
  opens a fresh connection (matches the daemon's protocol). Auto-discovers socket by walking up from
  workspace root. Auto-starts daemon if socket not found.
- **`transport/jsonl.ts`** — Parses `.beads/issues.jsonl` into an in-memory `Map<string, Issue>`.
  Supports read-only operations (list, show, ready, blocked, stats). Watches file via `fs.watch()`
  and reloads on change. Used as fallback when daemon is unavailable.
- **`transport/discovery.ts`** — Discovers `.beads/bd.sock` and `.beads/issues.jsonl` by walking up
  the directory tree from the workspace root.
- **`client.ts`** — High-level `BeadsClient` combining DaemonTransport + JsonlTransport. Full CRUD
  plus comments, labels, and dependencies via daemon; reads fall back to JSONL. Change detection via
  `ChangePoller` (polls daemon stats endpoint). Exports `watchMutations` convenience function.
- **`poller.ts`** — `ChangePoller` polls the daemon's `stats` endpoint on a configurable interval
  and emits change events to subscribers. Uses a `polling` guard flag to prevent overlapping
  requests; interval ticks that fire while a poll is in flight are skipped.
- **`mutation-poller.ts`** — `MutationPoller` polls the daemon's `get_mutations` endpoint and emits
  detailed mutation events (type, issue ID, status changes), unlike ChangePoller which only signals
  that something changed.
- **`batch.ts`** — `batched()` utility for running async operations with bounded concurrency
  (default 10). Used by `showMany`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany` on the client.
- **`registry.ts`** — Reads the global beads registry (`~/.beads/registry.json`) to discover
  available workspaces and check daemon process liveness.

`types.ts` holds all shared type definitions. `index.ts` is the barrel export.

## Daemon Protocol

Transport: Unix domain socket at `.beads/bd.sock`. Wire format: newline-delimited JSON. One request,
one response, then socket closes. The transport handles both newline-terminated and EOF-terminated
responses; if the daemon closes the socket without a trailing newline, buffered data is parsed on
the `end` event. Empty or malformed responses fail fast with a framing error instead of timing out.

Operations: `ping`, `health`, `list`, `show`, `ready`, `blocked`, `stats`, `create`, `update`,
`close`, `delete`, `dep_add`, `dep_remove`, `comment_add`, `comments`, `label_add`, `label_remove`,
`label_list`, `label_list_all`, `info`, `get_mutations`.

## Testing

Tests use Vitest. Tests for the JSONL transport and discovery module use temporary directories with
real files. Tests for the daemon transport use a mock Unix socket server to exercise response
framing scenarios (newline-terminated, EOF-terminated, chunked, empty, malformed). Tests for the
poller use mock transports and fake timers. Client tests use the JSONL fallback path (no daemon
required).

## Issue tracking

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

```bash
bd ready                                     # Find available work
bd show <id>                                 # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress          # Claim work
bd close <id>                                # Complete work
bd sync                                      # Sync with git
```
