### To do

### Done

- [x] Create EnhancedTextInput component with standard text editing shortcuts (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+W, Option+arrows)
- [x] When entering a task: the label "Todo", the input, and the instructions should be each on their own line - they currently seem to be in horizontally aligned cells
- [x] If I enter a task with double quotes, I get a git error
