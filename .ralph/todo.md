### To do

- [ ] Add a border below the header
- [ ] Use a nicer selection UI for the yes/no init question
- [ ] Should we use ink-markdown for processing markdown?
- [ ] For the header text, use ink-gradient from #30A6E4 to #EBC635
- [ ] In the header show `@herbcaudill/ralph vxxx` on the same line as the claude code version

---

### Done

- [x] Inline code blocks are being put in separate paragraphs
- [x] we're not picking up the Claude Code version - it's showing `Claude Code vunknown`
