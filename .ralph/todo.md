### To do

- [ ] Are we using a component for the todo input? It's missing some basic text editing functionality, like command-backspace to backspace a word, or option-left/right to move the cursor a word at a time.

### Done

- [x] When entering a task: the label "Todo", the input, and the instructions should be each on their own line - they currently seem to be in horizontally aligned cells
- [x] If I enter a task with double quotes, I get a git error
